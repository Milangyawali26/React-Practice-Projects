use is react api that lets you read the value of a resources like a promise or context.

const value =use(resources);

usage 
reading context with use 
when a context is passed to use, it works similarly to useContext. 
while useContext must be called at the top level of you component ,
 use can be called inside conditional like if and loops like for. 

 use is preferend over useContext because it is more flexible.


 instead of 'useContext' we should only use  "use"
