use reducer  is the alternative for use state hook 
it returns an array containing the current state and a dispatch function.

in complex use reducer is more often used 

const [state,dispatch] = useReducer(reducer,initialState);

reducer function = a function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state. 

dispatch function is used to send actions to the reducer , which in turns updates the state based on the action's type and any associated data (payload).
